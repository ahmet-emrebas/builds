      "I love aggressive and hasty side of myself because it helped me a lot to find the bests of the bests in my life.",

      "Programming and designing are my greatest passions and activities that I find myself calm and happy.",
      "I started my computer science journey in high school. I developed a calculator using Visual Basic, which made me feel valuable because of the feeling that I can do something for people. It was like giving a birth without any pain. I can say that it is the greatest impact on my future career.",
      "My passion of software development and designing has grown and grown over time, which boost my learning ability to the greatest extent.",
      "For the last 3 years, I have been working as a freelance web and mobile developer but I could not find much to improve myself and grow in my career. I want to be a part of a well-rounded team because I am so hungry to learn."
